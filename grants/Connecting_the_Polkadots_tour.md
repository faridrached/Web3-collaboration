Project desription: 

We are planning a worldwide series of seven meetups and workshops, aimed at a developer crowd, called: 'Connecting the Polkadots'. A series aimed to inspire local developers to contribute to the growth and development of Polkadot, Substrate and potentially Kusama. These meetups will be held in places where there is enough critical developer mass, but not as aware about Polkadot as they should be. (Don't expect cities like London, Berlin, Tokyo, but instead think Chicago, Toronto, NYC, Barcelona, Taipei, Tel Aviv, Cape Town and various cities in Latin America). The meetups will be held by me with use of the available meetup kit and the available Polkadot developer presentations. In the run-up to a meetup we aim to scout a local Polkadot enthusiast willing to assist if necessary. The idea is to build up momentum towards the Polkadot mainnet launch later in the year and to build the strongest and most decentralised developer community any cryptocurrency project has ever seen. 

This initiative is good for the ecosystem because novice and expert developers will be inspired and mobilised to build a decentralised future while enabling growth and development of one of the most exciting distributed ledger technologies around. 

Polkadot and Substrate will be integrally integrated while friendly focussing on the deployment and development of the software development goals as layed out in: https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md

I am interested in pushing this tour forward because Polkadot for me is one of the boldest, most advanced feats of distributed ledger technology out there and I believe in it's vision. Furthermore, during my travels while organising other developer meetups I have noticed that Polkadot isn't as well known and exposed as I would like to see. This tour focuses on the regions where there is still much exposure to be gained.

Team's experience

I have done successful tech meetups, developer events and multi-project mashups for projects like: Algorand, Mainframe, Dfinity, Tezos, Consensys, Hedera Hashgraph, POA Network, The Graph, Qtum, Fusion, Rchain, Ankr.Network, NuCypher, Solana, Avalanche Labs, Tomochain, Chromia, Quarkchain for example. I have worked with Thibaut Sardan as one of the speakers for my ''
Validate' series in Berlin. As this is quite a big list I have downsized the amount of projects I work with drastically and only aim help a handful of projects including Polkadot, AVA Labs, Algorand, Tezos, Cosmos and Ethereum. I only work with projects I truly believe in and that are genuinely pushing a decentralised vision forward, towards mainstream adoption. 

Next to meetups and roadshows I also organise my ‘Building the New Web’, 'Decentralised' and 'Validate' series around the world, tailored to inspire a crowd of developers, hackers and engineers to build a decentralised world. The events include showcases from 4-6 projects and an exciting Q&A and will or have been held in Denver, San Francisco, Paris, Hong Kong, Sydney, Cape Town, San Jose, New York, Toronto, Amsterdam and Tokyo. Here’s an impression from the Berlin edition:

The required grant per milestone and the total amount requested. 

I aim to organise the meetups as cost efficient as possible. Including venue hire, drinks, snacks, personal logistics and time needed to market every single meetup and generate the highest turnout possible, I am aiming for a 30.000 USD grant for organising at least seven meetups in the period of september, october and november. That's on average 4285 USD per meetup. 

When I have organised seven meetups and the budget isn't depleted yet, then I will add an eight or ninth meetup to the roster. The intention is to have fiat cover for the factual costs and DOT amount for the hours I am putting in organising and marketing all the meetups. Specifics will be emailed to grants@web3.foundation. 


The 3 month - 1 year plan is to apply for a secondary grant after genesis and keep the momentum going.
