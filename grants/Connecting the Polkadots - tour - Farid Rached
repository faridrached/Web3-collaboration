Connecting the Polkadots tour
## Project Description
We are planning a worldwide series of meetups and workshops, aimed at a developer crowd, called: 'Connecting the Polkadots'. A series aimed to inspire local developers to contribute to the growth and development of Polkadot, Substrate and potentially Kusama, and to let them apply for Web grants. 

This is a small grant request in order to validate it's added value, doing THREE meetups. When successfull, we will apply for a followup grant towards other cities. 

These meetups will be held in places where there is enough critical developer mass, but not as aware about Polkadot as they should be. (Don't expect cities like London, Berlin, Tokyo, but instead think Chicago, Toronto, Barcelona, Boston, Lisbon, Cape Town and various cities in Latin America). The meetups will be held by me with use of the available meetup kit and the available Polkadot developer presentations. In the run-up to a meetup we aim to scout a local Polkadot enthusiast willing to assist if necessary. The idea is to build up momentum towards the Polkadot mainnet launch later in the year and to build the strongest and most decentralised developer community any cryptocurrency project has ever seen. 

This initiative is good for the ecosystem because novice and expert developers will be inspired and mobilised to build a decentralised future while enabling growth and development of one of the most exciting distributed ledger technologies around. 

Polkadot and Substrate will be integrally integrated while friendly focussing on the deployment and development of the software development goals as layed out in: https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grants.md

I am interested in pushing this tour forward because Polkadot for me is one of the boldest, most advanced feats of distributed ledger technology out there and I believe in it's vision. Furthermore, during my travels while organising other developer meetups I have noticed that Polkadot isn't as well known and exposed as I would like to see. This tour focuses on the regions where there is still much exposure to be gained.

## Team's experience
I have done successful tech meetups, developer events and multi-project mashups for projects like: Algorand, Mainframe, Dfinity, Tezos, Consensys, Hedera Hashgraph, POA Network, The Graph, Qtum, Fusion, Rchain, Ankr.Network, NuCypher, Solana, Avalanche Labs, Tomochain, Chromia, Quarkchain for example. I have worked with Thibaut Sardan as one of the speakers for my ''Validate' series in Berlin, which was sponsored by ConsenSys. As this is quite a big list I have downsized the amount of projects I work with drastically and only aim help a handful of projects including Polkadot, AVA Labs, Algorand, Tezos, Cosmos and Ethereum. I only work with projects I truly believe in and that are genuinely pushing a decentralised vision forward, towards mainstream adoption. 

Next to meetups and roadshows I also organise my ‘Building the New Web’, 'Decentralised' and 'Validate' series around the world, tailored to inspire a crowd of developers, hackers and engineers to build a decentralised world. The events include showcases from 4-6 projects and an exciting Q&A and will or have been held in Denver, San Francisco, Paris, Hong Kong, Sydney, Cape Town, San Jose, New York, Toronto, Amsterdam and Tokyo. Here’s an impression from the Berlin edition:

## Project Roadmap

This proposal entails THREE meetups for the budget of 10.000 USD, or the equivalent, in DOTs. 

The milestones cover THREE meetups in November 2019 in Madrid, Lisbon and Barcelona towards a developer crowd. 

These will be organised in the week of November 18-21 2019, subject to availability of guestspeakers from Parity/Polkadot via livestream. 

Each meetup will:
- be put online 6-8 weeks in advance to gather maximum exposure
- be recorded for later use and maximum exposure, ultimately serving as a timecapsule for Polkadot development. 
- aim to attract 30-90 local developers interested to learn more about Polkadot/Kusama and potentially built related applications or tools. 
- have drinks and snacks
- will last max 3 hours. 

This section should break out the project roadmap into a number of milestones. Each milestone should represent the completion of a specific event or task, for example a meet-up, hackathon or workshop.

The budget of 10.000 USD for three meetups is to cover: 
- venue
- drinks and snacks
- recording/photography
- marketing time

When successful:
- When one or more of the attendees get inspired to help development of Polkadot and Kusama, related tools and apps. Partly measurable via potential applications for web3 development grants. 
- When one or more of the attendees get inspired to bootstrap a local Polkadot chapter
- A turnout of at least 30 high quality developers (which is completely trivial of course). Our aim is always to have the highest (quality) turnout. 
 
  * The team's long-term plans and intentions 
  
  The 3 month - 1 year plan is to apply for a secondary grant after these initial three meetups and keep the momentum going. Always in cities where extra exposure is needed. 

## Additional Information

Our meetups have attracted thousands of developers the past 18 months. Our aim is to focus a large part of our efforts on helping the grow the Polkadot developer ecosystem. Lets do this.
